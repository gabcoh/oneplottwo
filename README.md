It's a web based 3d grapher!! I still have a whole lot of work to do on it though.

# TODO 
- [ ] Better axes. More axes. Thicker prettier axes.
- [ ] A grid in addition to the axes.
- [ ] A ray tracer so I know what point I'm looking at.
- [ ] More equation types (Rectangular, Spherical, Implicit etc.)
- [ ] Cleaner code (better error handling and stuff)
