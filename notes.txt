NEXT STEPS

IT WORKS NOW MAKE CLEAN THEN IMPROVE (and stop using all caps for everything. this is why we can't have nice things)
reread all shit and finally decide on whether to throw or return errors (leaning throw)
also make sure that class hierarchies are as we want them to be and stuff. prune unused stuff
In other words, next step is make sure organization is good as outlined above, general code cleaning, error handling, testing, styling.

maybe just two types of equatoins, implicit and explicit because there really is no difference to the equaiton class what the coordinate system is

idea:
add A Ray tracer to see points

TODO 
fix varying line lengths (especially in comment texts)
